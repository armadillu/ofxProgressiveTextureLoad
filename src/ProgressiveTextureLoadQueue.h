	//valid ID (get_id() != std::thread::id()).
	//For some reason if we try to delete them it triggers a SIGABRT, so we at least store them
	//here to keep track of them. as the list grows, there might be a point in which no more threads
	//cant be spawned (unclear TODO! needs testing)
	//To be clear, this only seems to happen when the images to load are extremelly tiny, this seems to
	//make the thread life span so short, that by the time the thread is created its already done.
	//Another option is to make the thread sleep a bit after its done but that's not very pretty - TODO!
	// TLDR - if your textures are very small, you might be better of loading them directly.
